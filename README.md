# Distracted-Driver-Detection
State of the art model on Dataset "State Farm Distracted Driver Detection" using Fast.ai.

In this, I used the same steps with little tweaks to work on kaggle to produce very good results on the Dataset: "State Farm Distracted Driver Detection" link:
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data"> here</a>

In this, Via using transfer learning , we achieve these results which will be very difficult to produce in such a short code

The model used for Transfer Learning is resnet34.
